# Promotional html emails

## Netflix Originals: The Devil Next Door 
I built this Netflix promotional email clone because of its many movie choices. The layout is engaging, interactive, colorful and intuitive. I love the different layouts of the 3 sections showing the movie choices.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED:
 html tables, html, css, mobile responsive, npm, web accessibility, github, netlify, google lighthouse audit. For further inspection, see <a href="https://github.com/jerome-wilson-developer/email_promo-netflix-devil-next-door">

## ACCESSIBILITY:
I used accessibility code to increase this page's web accessibility. I mostly used aria-role landmarks and tabindex code to increase focus and access. There is a strong movement in the web development world to build and code web content that is accessible to everybody. Lawsuits and accessility standards are happenning regularly. Some statistics report there are over 1 billion people worldwide who have difficulties using web content because of different disabilities.
